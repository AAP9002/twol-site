          <div class="desc"><p>Hi all  and many thanks for your support with This Way Of Life.  We didnt crack the crowdfunding sum but we never gave up.   Thanks to the ease in the Covid Lockdown we have managed to get out and about and drum up more support for the project.  Its been hectic but short of signing contracts we have been blessed with a backer to support the full feature.  So its socks up as we stand waiting for the gun to launch us onto the road to make TWOL come to life.  Loads of exciting news to share as contracts are signed.
            <br /><br />
            Your amazing support got us to this stage and we cant thankyou enough for believing in us.
            <br /><br />
            If you supported us with a donation we will announce how much we will be contributing to our chosen charity Help For Heroes.
            <br /><br />
            If you supported us through purchasing a Perk I will be in touch individually but we are on track to manage posting by the end of September.  Keep em peeled for announcements.
            <br /><br />
            Once again a big THANK YOU from all at Team TWOL and here's to announcing more about the feature in the coming weeks x
